# Campaign Writing Standards

## Description Requirements

1. **Include dating clues in the description itself** - Military technology, tactics, formations, army sizes, and logistics that help narrow the time period. The description should give a knowledgeable player enough to make a reasonable guess.

2. **Avoid non-military identifying details:**
   - No religious holidays (gives away Yom Kippur War, Tet Offensive)
   - No operation names (Desert Storm, Barbarossa)
   - No country/people names - use "the invaders," "the defenders," "the empire," "the rebels" when possible. Avoid geographic identifiers like "an island nation" or "a northern kingdom" unless needed for clarity.
   - No specific dates within the text
   - Use "imperial" not "Roman," describe fighting styles rather than nationalities

3. **Technology details should be specific:**
   - Not just "guns" but "matchlock arquebuses requiring forked rests"
   - Not just "armor" but "chain mail hauberks with surcoats; great helms coming into fashion"
   - Not just "cavalry" but "lancers in heavy armor" or "horse archers with composite bows"

4. **Temporal language must be accurate:**
   - Don't say "decades" if you mean centuries
   - Be precise about relative timing ("a century earlier," "within a generation")

## Avoiding LLM-Style Prose

LLM-generated text has characteristic patterns that make it feel artificial. Descriptions should be sparse, direct, and focused on conveying information efficiently.

### Constructions to Avoid

These are fine occasionally but LLMs overuse them:

- **"Not an A, but a B"** - contrastive framing
- **"You might think X. Instead, Y."** - expectation subversion
- **"The F marked not just G, but also H"** - false-profundity padding
- **Em-dashes** - LLMs scatter these everywhere
- **Exhaustive lists** - "men, women, children, wagons, livestock" (just say "entire peoples" or "families")
- **Dramatic parallelism** - "settled as allies, then partners, then masters"

### Editorializing to Cut

- "The disaster shocked the world"
- "simply ceased to exist"
- "the end of an era"
- "would never fully recover"
- "Some historians date X from this day" (which historians? is this even true?)

These tell the reader how to feel instead of giving them information.

### Presenting Uncertainty

**Bad (vague hand-waving):**
> "Perhaps the garrisons had been stripped; perhaps the defenses had rotted. The sources don't say."

**Good (actual historiographical debate):**
> "Some historians think the frontier garrisons had been stripped to fight wars elsewhere; others argue the evidence for this is weak."

If there's a real scholarly debate, describe it. If you don't know, research it. Don't gesture vaguely at uncertainty.

### Hypotheses vs. Facts

Don't present hypotheses as facts. Example: the Rhine freezing in 406 AD is an 18th-century speculation by Gibbon, not attested in any contemporary source. Write "Later historians speculated the river froze" or just skip it.

### Motive and Significance

**Bad (imputing motive):**
> "wagons circled into an improvised fortress protecting their families"

**Good (stating facts):**
> "wagons circled into an improvised fortress, families and possessions inside"

**Bad (asserting significance):**
> "The crossing marked not just a military disaster but the end of an era."

**Good (letting facts speak):**
> "The empire never recovered the territory."

### Significance Must Be Concrete

**If claiming something is momentous**, replace with a specific consequence:

- Bad: "The battle marked a turning point in history."
- Good: "The victors annexed three provinces and held them for two centuries."

**If claiming military wisdom was proven wrong**, describe how contemporaries actually changed behavior:

- Bad: "The battle proved that cavalry could not defeat disciplined infantry."
- Good: "After the defeat, the king ordered all future armies to include pike blocks trained in the new formation."

**If claiming a battle shocked a nation**, describe specific responses:

- Bad: "The disaster shocked the world."
- Good: "The defeat triggered a political crisis; the commanding general was recalled and executed, and the senate voted to double the army's size."

Not every battle has world-historic import. Most don't. If you can't point to a specific consequence, don't claim significance.

### Sourcing and Uncertainty

For older history especially, acknowledge limited sourcing:

- "The sources for this period are thin; most details come from a single chronicler writing decades later."
- "Casualty figures from ancient battles are notoriously unreliable, but the sources agree the losses were severe."

Don't present contested reconstructions as fact. If historians disagree about what happened, say so.

### Historiographical Debates

When invited to decide who is right about historical questions, LLMs show a bias toward assuming modern historians are always right. The policies that produce the best writeups are more nuanced: historians of our time are fallible just like their predecessors. There's great modern scholarship, but you should not settle historiographical debates just by assuming the most recent take is ground truth.

There is always an original take available—you can always find a historian arguing something novel—but that doesn't mean you should assess it as credible. When evaluating competing interpretations:

- The best scholarship is grounded in specific details: who did what, acting on what information
- Be skeptical of interpretations that map neatly onto modern political debates (e.g., "refugees vs invaders" framing for ancient migrations)
- Traditional narratives often became traditional because they had explanatory power; dismissing them requires actual evidence, not just novelty
- "Later writers exaggerated X" doesn't mean X was fabricated from nothing

**Most historiographical debates don't need to feature at all.** Usually the right approach is to describe what the sources say happened, without claiming either the traditional or revisionist interpretation is correct. Don't write "19th-century historians thought X, but modern historians argue Y"—just describe what happened.

### The Core Principle

Write like a historian conveying information to someone who wants to learn, not like an AI trying to sound impressive. When in doubt: state the fact plainly, cut the commentary, research the actual debates.

### Research Before Writing

**Do not rely on "innate" knowledge.** LLMs frequently hallucinate details about battles: wrong dates, wrong commanders, wrong outcomes, invented tactical details. Always check against external sources (Wikipedia is fine) before writing or editing a campaign.

If you don't know:
- What the actual historiographical debates are
- What equipment/tactics were actually used
- What the primary sources say vs. what's later speculation

Then look it up. The goal is real information, not plausible-sounding filler.

## Hint Requirements

1. **Hints provide date ranges for technologies already mentioned** - They don't reveal new information, they help the player date what they already read.

2. **Hints must NOT:**
   - Name specific people (no "Timur", "Wellington", "Napoleon")
   - Name specific organizations (no "British East India Company", "Teutonic Knights")
   - Name specific battles or wars (no "this was common in the Napoleonic Wars")
   - Provide fame-based identification ("this commander would become famous")

3. **Format:** "Technology X was standard/used from roughly YEAR to YEAR. [Reason why it changed]."

4. **Two hints per campaign:**
   - First hint (15-20 pts): Broader technology dating
   - Second hint (20-25 pts): Narrower technology or contextual dating

5. **Verification checklist for each hint:**
   - [ ] Does the hint only reference things already in the description?
   - [ ] Does the hint avoid naming people, organizations, or battles?
   - [ ] Does the hint explain WHEN a technology was used, not just WHAT it was?

## Explanation Requirements (CRITICAL)

The explanation should read like **an earnest historian helping students revise for a final exam**—educational, informative, and rich with context. Not chatty or formulaic.

### Required Elements

1. **Proper nouns** - Name the battle, commanders, places, and specific units. This is the educational payoff after guessing.

2. **Historical significance** - What made this battle important? What were the consequences?

3. **Dating logic woven naturally** - Explain WHY details indicate specific time periods, but integrate this into the narrative rather than using formulaic patterns like "For dating: X = Y."

### Tone

- **Do:** Write like an earnest historian explaining to interested students
- **Don't:** Write like a streamer commenting on a quiz ("this totally screams 1200!")
- **Don't:** Use formulaic structures ("For dating: Technology X (1400-1500) + Context Y = Date")

### Bad (formulaic/sparse):
"This was the Battle of Kircholm in 1605. Matchlock muskets were standard from 1500-1700. Cavalry lancers had fallen from use in Western Europe by 1600 but remained effective in Eastern Europe. This combination indicates the early 17th century."
- Lists dating facts without historical context
- No proper nouns beyond the battle name
- Reads like a checklist, not an explanation

### Good (rich historical context with natural dating):
"This was the Battle of Kircholm on September 27, 1605, one of the greatest cavalry victories in history. Grand Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz led 3,600 Polish-Lithuanian cavalry—including the famous Winged Hussars—against 11,000 Swedish infantry under Charles IX's commander. The Hussars' charge shattered the Swedish formations in barely 20 minutes; Sweden lost over 8,000 killed while Polish casualties were under 100. Matchlock muskets with pike formations (standard 1500-1700) versus cavalry lancers (obsolete in Western Europe by 1600 but devastating in Eastern Europe) precisely identifies the early 17th century."

- Names commanders, units, and specific details
- Explains the battle's significance (one of history's greatest cavalry victories)
- Dating logic flows naturally as part of the explanation

### More Examples

**Constantinople 1453:**
"This was the Fall of Constantinople in 1453—the end of the Byzantine Empire after 1,123 years. Sultan Mehmed II ('the Conqueror'), age 21, besieged the city with ~80,000 Ottoman troops against Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos's 7,000 defenders. The massive bombards were cast on-site by Hungarian engineer Orban; the largest required 60 oxen to move. Constantine XI died fighting on the walls—the last Roman Emperor. The bombards having to be cast on-site places this in the early gunpowder period; by the 1480s mobile bronze cannon had made such monsters obsolete."

**Mogadishu 1993:**
"This was the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3-4, 1993, immortalized in Black Hawk Down. Task Force Ranger—Delta Force and Army Rangers—launched a daylight raid to capture lieutenants of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. Master Sergeant Gary Gordon and Sergeant First Class Randy Shughart volunteered to defend the second crash site; both were killed and received posthumous Medals of Honor. RPGs—cheap Soviet-designed weapons from the 1960s—brought down advanced helicopters and negated technological advantages, defining post-Cold War asymmetric warfare."

## Structure

```javascript
{
    id: "campaign_XXX",
    title: "Evocative but Non-Identifying Title",
    actualYear: YYYY,  // negative for BCE
    difficulty: "easy|medium|hard",
    description: `Multiple paragraphs with military technology details...`,
    hints: [
        { cost: 15-20, text: "Date range for technology...", explanation: "Brief note" },
        { cost: 20-25, text: "Narrower date range...", explanation: "Brief note" }
    ],
    explanation: "This was the Battle of X on [date], where [Commander A] faced [Commander B]. [Historical context and significance—what made this battle matter].

## Quality Review Checklist

After writing each campaign, verify:

### Description
- [ ] Contains specific military technology details (weapons, armor, formations)
- [ ] Avoids non-military identifying details (holidays, operation names, country names)
- [ ] Technology described specifically enough to date (not just "guns" but type of guns)
- [ ] Temporal language is accurate (don't say "decades" if it's centuries)
- [ ] No fame-based identifiers ("this commander would become famous")

### Hints
- [ ] Only reference technologies/contexts already in the description
- [ ] Provide date ranges with reasoning (why did this technology appear/disappear)
- [ ] Don't name specific people, organizations, or battles
- [ ] Don't use fame-based identification

### Explanation
- [ ] Names the battle, commanders, places, and specific units (proper nouns)
- [ ] Explains historical significance (why this battle mattered)
- [ ] Dating logic woven naturally into narrative (not formulaic)
- [ ] Tone: earnest historian helping students revise (not chatty, not a checklist)
- [ ] No fake reasoning (just asserting a date without explaining the logic)

### Overall
- [ ] Accurate historical information
- [ ] Interesting to read
- [ ] Fair difficulty (possible to narrow date from description alone)

## Checking for Duplicates

Before adding a new campaign, verify it doesn't already exist:

1. **Search for the battle name** in existing explanations:
   ```bash
   grep -i "agincourt\|battle name" campaigns.js
   ```

2. **Search for the year** to find campaigns from the same time:
   ```bash
   grep "actualYear: 1415" campaigns.js
   ```
   Then verify any matches are different battles (same year ≠ same battle).

3. **Search for key identifiers** (commander names, locations):
   ```bash
   grep -i "henry v\|francis i\|cortés" campaigns.js
   ```

## Coverage Gaps to Fill

When writing new campaigns, prioritize underrepresented:
- Regions: Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, Central Asia
- Periods: 6th-10th centuries, pre-classical ancient
- Types: Naval battles, sieges in non-European contexts
